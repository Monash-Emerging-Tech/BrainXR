# TrialSegment.tsx

One trial's slot in the 40-trial connected timeline: a baseline circle
(3s) followed by a stimulus bar (60s), clickable independently to seek to
that phase (`onTrialSelect(index, 0)` for baseline, `onTrialSelect(index, 3)`
for stimulus start).

**Props**: `index`, `isActive`, `isPast`, `phase`, `trialElapsed`, `onTrialSelect`.

Only the active segment (`isActive`) shows live fill progress and expands
via `flex-[30]`; past segments render fully filled, future segments empty.
The phase indicator badge ("Baseline Phase" / "Stimulus Phase") is rendered stationary at the timeline level above the baseline of Trial 1.
